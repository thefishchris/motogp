A = Mon Apr 03 2023 18:42:34 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time) B = 2023-04-02T18:00:00+00:00 there are two different formats for dates here, A and B for simplicity. A is today and B is either in the future or has already passed. I need to use reactjs to display B only if it is in the future, if it is not in the future add 1 to nextDate.
